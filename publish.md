## 2. What is this {#2-the-what}

A letter from ICICI customer (customer ID TODO), who has not paid EMIs regularly for loans TODO.

This letter has the following purposes

 1. providing sound reason for

   1.1 not paying EMIs regularly since June 2025
   1.2 inability to start EMI payment

 2. requesting amicable terms and moratorium period

## 1. Why this is sent {#1-the-why}

This is to ease your (as in the bank's) uneasiness, and bring clarity from my end.

I apologize for being so late in sending this. I've been trying, but the greatest reasons were

 * my guilt of not being able to pay, and
 * reluctance to speak up without proper paperwork in place (especially to someone with huge authority as yours).

## 3. Important note on how to use it {#3-the-how}

I am not in the best psychological condition and have cognitive decline also, but *me not communicating due to fear and anxiety is making both of us (the bank and me) more uneasy everyday*.

So I am sending a "good enough" draft, **please note** this is live document, I will add supporting evidence to as many claims as possible when possible.

To prove my goodwill, nature of upholding ethics, abiding with law to best of my knowledge, and non-malevolence <!--(e.g. changing claims in a way that drastically changes narrative)--> this document lives on a github git repo where you can track every change. And every version that's good enough will have a cryptographically secure hash printed in header TODO.
