## 2. What is this {#2-the-what}

A letter from ICICI customer (account number 00030 161 3381), who has not paid EMIs regularly for loans LPBRD00050403016 and LPBRD00050846805.

This letter serves the following purposes:

 1. provides sound reason for

   a. me not paying EMIs regularly since June 2025
   b. my inability to start EMI payment anytime soon

 2. request amicable terms and moratorium period

## 1. Why this is sent {#1-the-why}

This is to ease your (as in the bank's) uneasiness, and bring clarity to the table from my end.

I apologize for being so late in sending this writeup. I've been trying, but the greatest reasons of delay were

 * my guilt of not being able to pay,
 * reluctance to speak up without proper paperwork (especially to someone with huge authority as yours), and
 * my circumstances

## 3. Important note on how to read this {#3-the-how}

I am not in the best psychological condition and have cognitive decline also, but *me not communicating due to fear and anxiety is making both of us (the bank and me) more uneasy everyday*.

So I am sending a "good enough" draft, **please note** this is live document, I will add supporting evidence to as many claims as possible when possible.

Also, this is written by me. I am an (sub-average) engineer, not a lawyer, and I didn't hire anyone to write this for me.

To help strengthen my goodwill and further prove my nature of upholding ethics, abiding with law to best of my knowledge, and non-malevolence <!--(e.g. changing claims in a way that drastically changes narrative)--> this document lives on a github git repo where you can track every change. And every version that's good enough will have a cryptographically secure hash added to PDF metadata and as information on last page.

If you send me an email ID, I could include you in a group so you can see updates (which progressively proves genuineness of the case) as they happen on the repo.

### Why not paying EMIs

I am victim of (please note the bullet points are not numbered since they affect each other, and ordering doesn't make sense):

 * illegal lay off (social discrimination) (TODO #later) which left me in a mental **and** legal state that prevents me from getting a white collar job
 * illegal salary denial the same company that did the above (missed raises can't be proven here, but will be included in above evidence, and they didn't give 2 months salary but filed 26AS otherwise see: )
 * I suffered cognitive and functional decline due to job and mother's condition (leading to physiological issues also) 
 * (during clonazepam prescription) psychiatric medicines which prevent me from driving 2-wheeler or operating machinery safely
 * I had to stop psychiatric medicines to protect my father's mental health - suddenly stopping medication (half-way, that too psychiatric medicines) back fires and leaves me in severe anxiety (among other conditions) and unable to function normally (in June 2022: I was good enough e.g. finished 2 programmers week worth of work in 6 hours in one sitting, but in current times it took me 5 months to write this)

I feel ashamed of writing the following words, but 

 * my mother was combating some form of neurological issue (doctors labelled it atypical/vascular parkinsonism) and her condition declined approximately bi-monthly in last 3 years (please cross examine that most of my expenditure was on medical bills only). Since mid-January 2025 most of my time had
 * I took gold loan to feed my family, but . my mother went to Kailash . few months back, and my only focus, if any, is to earn enough money to get the gold back

### Bank's infractions

(I am already scared of your power, what can I say...)

<!--I believe the following are applicable (from me onto you):

 * breaking RBI rules
 * attempt to murder
 * unintentional attempt to murder
 * breaking promise, defrauding
 * misinformation
 * defamation in front of CIBIL
 * threats
 * intentional hurt
 * tresspassing despite warning
 * harassment
 * preventing access to stable life and job-->

### Goodwill (past present and future)

You probably think of me as a cheat/thief/low-life, so I won't spend time preaching numbers or famous blunders. But, on basis of objective evidence of past, I must try to appeal to your better judgement:

 * I am hardworking

   * first-class mechanical engineering graduate, university topper
   * 95th %ile in NPTEL IIT-M Algorithms and Data Structures test
   * changed career *without formal training*, and exceeded peers (who had traditional 3-4 year college)
   * scored 8.5 bands in IELTS Academic
   * completed several projects with namesake team support

 * I may have potential

   * got scholarship in programming language design in 2022
   * got several scholarships (but couldn't join any) from several schools for AI and ML
   * independently discovered Djikstra's A* seach algorithm
   * was [working](https://github.com/s-c-p/letter-to-icici-for-pl/blob/57d18e2c9302081cfb0de3cf3e9a154b49046e68/assets/ai-work.png) on AI image/video generation and broken-english-but-hallucination-free SME chatbot **in 2022** (ChatGPT was available for public in November, I had working prototype in March see https://bit.ly/4a0SiAz; *can you name one India-based IITian/IISc-ian who was working on either image-gen/NLU-chatbots in that era?*)

 * I am honest

   * I never copied answers in exam after 9th standard
   * Turned down chance to study in Canada because I felt I didn't justify the course requirements (despite professor extending offer letter and visa)
   * I approached you (as in the bank) before I was about to default
   * I was actually hopeful of getting a job, and **didn't have any plan/intent to default on the loans**, which is why instead of otherwise running away with extra ~4 lac that I got in February 2025, I **chose to stay put and continued paying EMIs until it was possible** June 2025.

### Proposal

As discussed earlier, my only focus and priorities are my father's health and earning enough to get gold back.

Therefore, despite having some money (left from gold loan), I will earn and save as much as possible for gold loan settlement and not be able to make any EMI deposits towards loans LPBRD00050403016 and LPBRD00050846805. As requested earlier, please ***consider*** the following:

 1. in light of circumstances and merit of the case: writing off both the loans so that I am not entitled to pay any amount for closure.
 2. (my preference) please give a moratorium period of 12-20 years so I can pay the amount back to ICICI.

In either case, it is **crucial** that my CIBIL score is not spoiled.
